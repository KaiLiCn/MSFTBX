# Dependencies of `MSFileToolbox Module` NetBeans module suite
This NBM (NetBeans Module) is only needed when MSFileToolbox is used as an NBM.

Note that `jaxb` dependencies are only needed here, when MSFileToolbox is used as
a regular jar, they are not required. This is because of some stupid xerces bug in
NetBeans itself.
